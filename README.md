TramlineProcessor

TramlineProcessor is a robust geospatial data processing tool designed to analyze and segment a sequence of geographic points (or machine data) into meaningful tramline segments. It is built using Python and leverages powerful libraries such as GeoPandas, Pandas, Shapely, and NumPy. This project showcases advanced techniques in spatial data manipulation and is an excellent example of integrating geospatial analysis with real-world data processing requirements.
Key Capabilities

    Bearing Calculation:

    Computes the directional bearing between points, ensuring that the calculated bearings fall within a normalized range [0, 360).

    Dynamic Segmentation:

    Uses both spatial (distance) and angular thresholds, along with a lookahead mechanism, to intelligently break a polyline into smaller, manageable segments.

    Adaptive Thresholding:

    Adapts the distance threshold dynamically based on the median and standard deviation of spatial distances between consecutive points, ensuring robust segmentation in varying data conditions.

    Crossing Resolution:

    Implements a sweep-line algorithm to detect and remove line crossings within the segments. When intersections occur, the segments are precisely split to maintain continuity and clarity.

    Temporal Clustering:

    Integrates temporal information by analyzing time gaps between points. This allows for clustering points that naturally form clusters over time, followed by conversion into spatial segments.

    Segment Assignment:

    Matches each geographic point with its corresponding segment identifier, enabling detailed subsequent analyses or visualizations.

    Deviation Detection & Flagging:

    Identifies the main tramline directions by analyzing bearing distributions, and subsequently flags points that deviate from these directions. Additionally, it detects and flags small “islands” (minor segments) that may result from noise or anomalies in the data.

Process Workflow

    Polyline Segmentation:

    The process begins with segmenting the overall polyline (formed from a sequence of points) into smaller segments based on calculated angles and distance thresholds. This ensures that the directional flow of the tramline is maintained, while abrupt changes prompt new segment creation.

    Bearing Assignment and Normalization:

    Each segment is assigned a smoothed bearing value. These bearings are then normalized and integrated within the original data, providing a clean directional summary for every point.

    Main Direction Identification:

    By generating a histogram of the smoothed bearings from the data, the tool determines the principal tramline directions, making it possible to compare individual segment bearings against expected directions.

    Segment ID Allocation:

    Each point is mapped to a segment ID based on its spatial correspondence within the final segments. When multiple segments converge, the tool intelligently assigns the segment with the longer segment length.

    Filtering Small Islands:

    Using group-based statistics, small clusters that might represent noise or insignificant deviations are flagged and filtered out. This finalizes a cleaned dataset, marking potential deviations and inconsistencies for further review.

    End-to-End Processing:

    The run method orchestrates the entire pipeline—from processing the polyline, assigning bearings and segment IDs, to finally flagging small islands and deviations—all with integrated logging for transparency and debugging.



TramlineProcessor is a testament to designing flexible, scalable, and intelligent geospatial processing pipelines. It reflects capabilities in data analysis, problem-solving, and the integration of diverse Python libraries to solve real-world challenges.
